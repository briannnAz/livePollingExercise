# livePollingExercise
# This is a repo set up for the Live Polling Exercise Given to me by the teams at IGN and Ziff Davis

#For this exercise I chose to Create it with:
- Next JS ( which is new to me but seemed like something that can easily be picked up) 
- Material UI ( which I have seen before in looking at CSS classes but havent used until now). 
- MongoDB or CassandraDB (Undecided at this point.

Not only did I feel it would be it would be a nice way to pick up new resources for myself but, I felt for a small exercise like this, it would be be the most efficient for compiling something that should be experienced in real time.
