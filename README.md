# livePollingExercise
# This is a repo set up for the Live Polling Exercise Given to me by the teams at IGN and Ziff Davis

#For this exercise I chose to Create it with:
- Next JS ( which is new to me but seemed like something that can easily be picked up) 
- Material UI ( which I have seen before in looking at CSS classes but havent used until now). 
- MongoDB with Functions accessed by Data APIs (for ease of retrieveing data with API Key security);

Not only did I feel it would be it would be a nice way to pick up new resources for myself but, I felt for a small exercise like this, it would be be the most efficient for compiling something that should be experienced in real time.

- Was On Track to Fully finishing everything I wanted to get done but then I ran into the CORS Policy issue. After trying a large number of things to get my api calls to work, nothing seemed to have helped remedy the situation, leaving 2 DB API calls I wanted to do, nearly impossible to test without compromising Google Chrome. Will try again with chrome cors disabled.

- Will add functions with the idea of it working in mind

- Was able to work around the CORS issue by relying on using multiple pages for getServerSideProps data fetching
